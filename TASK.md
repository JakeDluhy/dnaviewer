# DNA Molecule Viewer Task

## Introduction
This repository implements a very simple single page application (SPA) that renders a diagram
and table given some JSON data about a piece of DNA. DNA sequences have particular subsegments that have a special
function. These are called DNA Features. The goal is to show a scientist the Dna Features in a particular DNA
molecule. One way of doing this is with a set of symbols called Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual).
Check it out here: http://www.sbolstandard.org/visual
A quick Google Search for "Plasmid Diagram" (plasmids are a type of circular DNA molecule) will show you many different
designs.


## The Task
Using a JSON fixture as a data source, render the DNA molecule in the browser. You should draw a diagram of the DNA
molecule and its features and also a table of the DNA molecule's features. Beyond this, there are many things you can do
so this is a good place to show off your creativity. Some additional behaviours you may want to consider are:

- Zoom, rotate, or change the scale of the diagram
- Toggle the visibility of particular features
- Show the sequence associated with particular features
- Allow a user to change the sequence of particular features
- Allow a user to search the table of DNA features

## Other requirements
- You can use any set of Javascript, HTML, and CSS frameworks or libraries you choose, but you should not use flash or
other browser plugins.

- Code quality is as important as functionality, so be sure to pick a consistent style, comment your code, and implement
whatever tests and documentation you feel are appropriate.
